The part one focus on the experimentation of the repositories TimeEval, TimeEval-algorithms, GutenTAG, the main code to follow this journey is : main.ipynb

We got lot's of problem of compatibility for the part with the actual repositories, so please follow those steps to make sure you can run the code successfully.

Please open the main notebook file, we did the step with the right versions one after the other. So you can just run the notebook from the beginning to the end.

!! It will clone 2 repos !

you can also run the instructions in bash, but you will have to change the path of the files in the notebook.

Ou previous repo was with python script but it was too hard to maintain, so we decided to use a single kernel with a notebook.

The second part is an exploration more deep of the concept by recoding ourselves the structure:

the content related main is in main_2.ipynb
